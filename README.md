# I2I-GANs

Common generative adversarial networks (GANs) implemented in TensorFlow 2.4.1. The GANs are suitable
for image-to-image translation tasks.

The following architectures are implemented:
- TraVeLGAN (https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/travelgan)
- DiscoGAN (https://github.com/SKTBrain/DiscoGAN)
- GcGAN (https://github.com/hufu6371/GcGAN)
